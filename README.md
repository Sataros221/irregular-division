# Irregular Division Generator

A Python script to generate a set of numbers that sum up to a target value, divided into parts with controlled variation.

## Description

## Features

- Generates numbers with controlled variation (Â±10% by default).
- Ensures the sum of all numbers matches the target exactly.
- Handles rounding errors and adjusts the last number to maintain precision.
- Exports results to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies (uses built-in modules: `random` and `csv`).

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python Division_Irregular.py
